\textbf{Learning}
Learnt about puzzles, and also even took the time to learn a couple of sequences of moves that are sufficient to solve \textbf{RC}, 2x2x2 in labout one minute, 3x3x3 in about 2 minutes.
\\
\\
\textbf{Implementation}
Implemented a bunch of solvers. Ideally should do in C++ for speed and multithreaded (esp for MCTS)
\\
\\
\textbf{DRL \& DQL}
Quite impressive, without too much effort, how well they perform. However, I feel to really get more out of them (higher dimensions in particular) would need careful tuning of the convergence criteria.
